# Vue-Java-PostgreSQL
## An exercise in creating a fullstack system using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) in the frontend, [Java](https://www.java.com/) in the backend, and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database.

**The frameworks used were [Spring](https://spring.io/) for the backend, and [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) for the frontend (HTML, CSS and JavaScript included).**

- It mocks a school's website with functions to list, register and run special queries on student names and test scores in a remote database.
- It does not feature any authentication or data security systems.
- I focused on using as many different Vue features as possible when developing, specially the newer ones, so the coding standard might feel weird.

*This entire system was created in only a week by myself and with no prior Vue experience (and only VSC installed and configured)!*

#### In order to properly run this system, the frontend (at localhost:9999), backend (at localhost:8080) and database (at localhost:5432) must be setup and configured correctly using the aforementioned frameworks. Check the source code for details. ####
